# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   -For this project, I have chosen to use Windows 11 as my operating system. I downloaded the Windows 11 installer from the official Microsoft website:https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   I followed the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11 on my machine.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   -I selected Visual Studio Code as my text editor for this project. I downloaded the installer from the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   After downloading the installer, I ran it and followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   3.1 Install Git
-I downloaded and installed Git from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
I followed the installation wizard and accepted the default settings.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  -I need to use Python. I downloaded and installed Python from the official Python website:
http://www.python.org
I followed the installation wizard and made sure to select the option to add Python to the system's PATH variable.

 -I need to use Dart. I downloaded and installed dart from the official Dart website:
 https://dart.dev/get-dart
 I followed the installation wizard and made sure to select the option to add dart to the system's PATH variable.
 -I need to use Flutter. I downloaded and installed Flutter from the official Flutter website:
  https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
 I followed the installation wizard and made sure to select the option to add Flutter to the system's PATH variable.


5. Install Package Managers:
   -Since this project requires Python, I also installed the Python package manager, pip. The pip installer is included in the Python installation, so no additional steps were needed.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   -For this project, I need to use a MySQL database. I downloaded and installed MySQL from the official MySQL website:
    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
    I followed the MySQL installer wizard and selected the "Custom" installation type. I chose to install the MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Shell components.
    During the installation, I set the root password for the MySQL server and made a note of it for future reference.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
    -I will be working directly on my local machine.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   -After installing Visual Studio Code, I explored the available extensions and plugins to enhance my development experience. Some of the extensions I installed include:
Python: Provides support for the Python programming language, including code completion, linting, and debugging.
Dart: Dart Code extends VS Code with support for the Dart programming language, and provides tools for effectively editing, refactoring, running, and reloading Flutter mobile apps.
Flutter: This VS Code extension adds support for effectively editing, refactoring, running, and reloading Flutter mobile apps. It depends on (and will automatically install) the Dart extension for support for the Dart programming language.
Monokai Dark Ninja: Extra dark VS Studio Code theme based on Monokai, with vibrant colours.
GitLens: Enhances the Git functionality within Visual Studio Code, providing additional information and tools for working with Git repositories.
Prettier: Automatically formats code to maintain a consistent style across the project.

9. Document Your Setup:
    -This document serves as the comprehensive documentation of the steps I've taken to set up my developer environment for this project.
 
 Challenges and Solutions
During the setup process, I encountered a few minor challenges:
-Git Installation: Initially, I had some issues with the Git installation, as I was unsure which version to download. After consulting the documentation, I was able to download the correct version for my operating system.
-MySQL Configuration: Setting up the MySQL database required some additional configuration, such as setting the root password and ensuring the necessary services were running. I referred to the MySQL documentation to resolve these issues.
-Visual Studio Code Extensions: Exploring and selecting the appropriate extensions for my development needs took some time, as there are many options available. I reviewed the extension descriptions and user ratings to find the most suitable ones for my project.
Overall, the setup process went smoothly, and I was able to overcome the challenges by referring to the relevant documentation and online resources.

Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this document, I have successfully set up a robust and productive developer environment for my software engineering project. I am now ready to begin coding, debugging, and collaborating on the project using the tools and configurations I have put in place.
